# Loco (aka Minerailed)

This project was first created by [@DerBanko](https://github.com/DerBanko) and [@Dweags](https://github.com/Dweags) (at least i saw it in the streams first), but nobody works on it at the moment, which is why I wanted to roll up the whole project again. The goal is to recreate at least a part of [Unrailed!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1016920/Unrailed/) in Minecraft, but as development goes, it evolved to a new discovery of Minecraft.

**PRs are welcome if I'm not working on this issue/feature.**

This project is in WIP and is far away from production.

Oh, if I didn't told you already:
